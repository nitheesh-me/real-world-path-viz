## 📝 Credits

This package was created with [Cookiecutter][cookiecutter] 🍪 and the [fedejaure/cookiecutter-modern-pypackage][cookiecutter-modern-pypackage] 📦 project template. We would like to thank the Cookie Monster for his contribution to this project. Without his love for cookies, this project would not have been possible.

The ideation for this project was inspired by the [A* (A-Star) Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization on a Real Map][youtube-video] 🌍 YouTube video by [@onesandzeros4312][youtube-channel] 👨‍💻.

### 🙏 Acknowledgements

We would also like to thank our parents, our pets, and our favorite coffee shops for keeping us caffeinated and motivated throughout the development process.

We would also like to give a shoutout to our favorite fictional characters who inspired us to pursue our dreams of becoming developers. To Harry Potter, for teaching us the importance of perseverance and friendship. To Tony Stark, for showing us that even geniuses make mistakes.
